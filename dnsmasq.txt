USEFUL TIPS ABOUT DNSMASQ
=========================

You can have an arbitrary executable ran everytime a DHCP lease is created or destroyed.

``dhcp-script=/bin/echo``

The DHCP server stores it's leases in this file by default:

``dhcp-leasefile=/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases``


Add domains which you want to force to an IP address here.
The example below send any host in doubleclick.net to a local
webserver.

``address=/doubleclick.net/127.0.0.1``


Choose which DNS server is used for resolution
----------------------------------------------

# Change this line if you want dns to get its upstream servers from
# somewhere other that /etc/resolv.conf
#resolv-file=

# By  default,  dnsmasq  will  send queries to any of the upstream
# servers it knows about and tries to favour servers to are  known
# to  be  up.  Uncommenting this forces dnsmasq to try each query
# with  each  server  strictly  in  the  order  they   appear   in
# /etc/resolv.conf
#strict-order

# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/resolv.conf or any other
# file, getting its servers from this file instead (see below), then
# uncomment this.
#no-resolv

# If you don't want dnsmasq to poll /etc/resolv.conf or other resolv
# files for changes and re-read them then uncomment this.
#no-poll
