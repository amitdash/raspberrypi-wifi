Android DNS Redirection
=======================
When you redirect DNS on an android tablet, it caches the false DNS information.
If you allow the tablet to go into the wild without clearing this fake DNS address
the tablet will not be able to connect to any redirect domains.
To be safe you must clear the cache before or after you use the Raspberry AP.

**Clear DNS Cache through Android Browser**:

    Not all Android phone browsers have the capability, but some do. 
    In your browser, select More. Select Settings, and then Clear Cache. 
    Click "OK" to complete the process.
